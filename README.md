# FitWins

A progressive web app for an in-family weight-loss competition. The purpose of the app is to help tracking the weight loss of the logged in members, and for me to learn VueJS PWA development with Firebase (+Firestore).

## Technologies used

- VueJS/Vuex
- Firebase (w Firestore)
- Facebook login
- Vuetify
- vuexfire
- moment.js

## Notes

If you wish to set up your own app for you own competition, contact me at hello@zseer.eu and I will kindly help you out with instructions.
